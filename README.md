# Disk-Optimizer
Write files optimally on disks.

Besides external HDDs and cloud storage, optical storage facilities (CDs, DVDs, etc.) are still used for data backup. It is often of interest how to place data on
them so that the minimum number of disks are required. Manual distribution for many files are cumbersome, therefore some kind of automation is welcome.

Currently the Best Fit Decreasing algorithm is used.
